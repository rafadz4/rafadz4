## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**rafadz4/rafadz4** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Iâ€™m currently studying Electronics Engineering and learning about backend development with Python. 
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and seeking help to improve my programming skills. 
Feel free to ask me about electronics and backend development. Oh, and Iâ€™m a big F1 fan!
